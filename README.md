# Rebellion_system_model

This python software create a complex software system about rebellion. You can type several parameter to change the behavior of the system and analysis them. Also there will be a line chart to help you analyse the enviornment.

step 4:
close the simulation interface, you can re-enter setting parameter and run again.
